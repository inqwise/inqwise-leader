Leader Election for Vert.x Clusters using the Raft Consensus Algorithm

== Purpose

The Inqwise-Leader project provides an implementation of leader election for Vert.x clusters using the Raft Consensus Algorithm.
It ensures consistent and reliable leader election in distributed environments, enabling scenarios where exactly one node in the cluster must perform scheduled or critical operations.

== Use Cases
	•	Running exactly one scheduled process in a Vert.x cluster.
	•	Ensuring singleton resource access across cluster nodes.
	•	Coordinating cluster-wide tasks reliably.
	•	Maintaining failover resilience when a leader node goes offline.

== How It Works

The implementation follows the principles of the Raft Consensus Algorithm (Raft Website):
	1.	Leader Election: Nodes in the Vert.x cluster elect one node as the leader.
	2.	Log Replication: The leader communicates tasks or commands to follower nodes.
	3.	Consistency and Fault Tolerance: Ensures cluster reliability and consistency even during node failures.

== Key Features
	•	Reliable Leader Election: Guarantees that only one node acts as a leader at any time.
	•	Automatic Failover: Seamless recovery when the leader node fails.
	•	Lightweight Integration: Optimized for use in Vert.x applications.
	•	Extensible Design: Easily adapt to various cluster architectures.
